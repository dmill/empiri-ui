        <h3>How is publishing a paper on Empiri different from the traditional process?</h3>
        <p>Empiri differentiates itself with a combination of open-access content, open peer-reviews, infinite revision history, and instantaneous publishing.</p>

        <h3>How does the peer-review process work?</h3>
        <p>Reviews for a publication are 100% open - anyone can view the author and content of a review in perpetuity. Reviews have no time limit or maximum number. If a qualified reviewer reads a publication six months after it goes out, a review can still be left.</p>

        <h3>Why would we want an open-review process?</h3>
        <p>An open review process allows the community to transparently decide the quality of a publication. The current peer-review process allows many low-quality publications to slip through the cracks while simultaneously giving these same publications a false sense of authority. It also excludes a great deal of quality research that challenges the status quo or simply gets unlucky with the reviewers to which it is assigned.</p>

        <h3>So you&#39;re letting anyone publish a paper without peer-reviews?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Publishing papers before they are reviewed dramatically reduces the time and energy required to publish. Once published, papers will accumulate reviews to establish their credibility as sound science.</p>

        <h3>What does publishing iteratively mean?</h3>
        <p>Content can be published in atomic chunks. Rather than waiting years to compile discussion of new results into an entirely new paper, our platform allows authors to publish at whatever frequency and speed they prefer. Rather than writing a whole new paper, we encourage authors to frequently update their existing publications.</p>

        <h3>So anyone can peer-review my paper?</h3>
        <p>Yes, any qualified expert in your field. An open review process facilitates discussion and debate so any credible reviewer can voice their feedback. As a result, authors get an increased sample size of reviewers and readers get multiple third-party opinions on the publication they&#39;re reading.</p>

        <h3>Can I collaborate with other authors on my publication?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Our model makes so-called "crowd-sourced" science much more feasible. Scientists working on the same project can easily share and discuss results.</p>

        <h3>What is a shared hypothesis?</h3>
        <p>Shared hypotheses provide a mechanism for authors supporting the same hypothesis to compile their work together in a central location. For example, a group of medicinal chemists developing a new pharmaceutical to treat Parkinson&#39;s Diesease could combine their work with that of neuroscientists, clinicians, and epidemiologists who are all supporting the efficacy of the new drug.</p>

        <h3>How can I learn more? How can I contribute?</h3>
        <p>If the open science movement is something that you&#39;re passionate about, we would love to work with you more closely. We want our platform to work the way that you want it to work, and in order to make that happen we need your suggestions, criticisms and general feedback.
